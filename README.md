nagctl
=======

Command line tool to manage large nagios instances. 

### History
While working in previous company, I was using cmd line tool to manage large nagios instance. 
After moving to present workplace same problem arose. A lot of clicks were needed to manage nagios. 

I asked Lesław about license of his tool and was delighted to hear it was developed under GPL3. 
Lesław, for his own reasons, didn't want to publish it on github but had nothing against us to do so.
